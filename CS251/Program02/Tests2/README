the complete test suite used to grade your submission.
However, they may not be the ONLY test cases used for
grading.


------------------------------------

Test programs:

  t1AB.cpp
  t1A_timed.cpp
  t1CD.cpp
  t1D_timed.cpp
  t1E.cpp
  t1E_timed.cpp

  t2A.cpp
  t2A_timed.cpp
  t2B.cpp
  t2C.cpp
  t2C_timed.cpp

These tests total 120 points.

RUNNING TESTS:

  Place your implementation of GridWorld.h into
  a directory containing all of these files.

  You can run the tests individually or in
  'batch' mode by running the script run_tests.
  The script will produce a subdirectory called
  _TEST_RESULTS containing summaries of the
  tests.


         IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE:  the file run_tests is a bash script
         and must have "executable permission" to run as shown
         above.

         As given, it does have executable permission, but if
         you download it directly, your downloaded version may
         not have executable permission (kind of a safety thing
         I suppose).

         In the unix world, you correct this with
