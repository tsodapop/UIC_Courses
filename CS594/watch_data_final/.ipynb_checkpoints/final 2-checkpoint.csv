Due to the complexity involved in its production and the difficulties implied by attempts to miniaturise it, this ingenious discovery which guarantees a regular and perfectly isochronous development of the balance-spring was reserved exclusively for marine chronometers and a few generously sized pocket-watches. Innovative watchmakers chafed at this regrettable situation, since its rating characteristics are unanimously considered to be infinitely better than those of a flat balance-spring.

The engineers and watchmakers of the Manufacture proved able to grasp the opportunity represented by the spherical tourbillon and to present a cylindrical balance-spring nestling at the heart of a wristwatch.

These 3 components came together in the Reverso à Eclipse of Jaeger-LeCoultre where the enamellers created an exquisite piece of art on the dial. The painting of Van Gogh’s infamous Sunflowers appears as a hidden treasure beneath the dial when the shutters are opened. 
 
A unique reversible watch featuring a pink gold case equipped with the in-house Jaeger-LeCoultre Calibre 849, the Reverso à Eclipse ideally lends itself to reviving one of the rarest fine art traditions – miniature enamel painting – that demands particular virtuosity and patience. A simple gesture is enough to open the watch dial shutters concealing an exquisite miniature reproduction of Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers.
 
This unique masterpiece, of which only five examples have been crafted, was achieved in conjunction the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The finished pieces can be admired at the Van Gogh Museum from September 4th 2015, when the new entrance building is officially inaugurated.
