Oak Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60634, to Charles P. Steinmetz College Prep,
located at 3030 North Mobile Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60634.
 
 
During a comprehensive replacement of Locke’s
roof, the structural engineer overseeing the renovation identified extensive
concrete deterioration following the removal of the masonry. The concrete
deterioration is structurally significant and potentially compromises the
capacity of the beam that supports the mansard roof framing of the second floor
classrooms of the west side of the school. The structural engineer determined
that relocating the west side second floor classrooms is appropriate and in the
best interest of student safety.
 
 On September 11, 2019, upon notification from
the structural engineer that the west side second floor classrooms would need
to be evacuated, Locke administration relocated students to alternate locations
within the school on a temporary basis.
 
 To ensure the continued safety of students and
staff, starting Monday, September 16, 2019, all 7th and 8th grade students will
move to an interim facility, Steinmetz College Prep, which is less than one
mile from Locke Elementary School. It is expected that 7th and 8th grade
students will return to Locke on January 6, 2020.  More information
regarding this emergency relocation is detailed in the notice letter to parents
and guardians of students.
 
 The district is unable to comply with applicable
requirements pursuant to 105 ILCS 5/34-200 through 5/34-235 due to the
