#running the code will enable you to find the number of subsets and minimum subsets for a value T.
#the code is run via:
#	num_of_subsets(data, T)
#where the data is already pre-set based on the projdata1.txt file, and the T is manually input value

#the output will be based on if it can find a possible subset
#if it is not feasible, it will print "not feasible"
#else, it will print out that it did find subsets, the total num of subsets, 
#the smallest subset size, and the num min subsets
